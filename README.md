# Classification---From-Scratch
In this assignment we will be implementing several classification algorithms from scratch i.e. not use any libraries and create our own libraries then we compare our results with the results obtained when we use library and see how efficiently we have implemented our own library

We will be using following dataset of dimensions (a*b)


## 1. LDA
Here we will reduce the higher dimensional data to one dimensional data while maximixing the difference of the means and minimizing the sum of variances of the clusteres.For understanding the complete theory of the algorithm please refer to following links in the sequence in which it has been given.

Please refer to the following link to refer to the code implementatiion 

#################Analying the results obtained - Report

Showing the intersection point of the normal distribution of both 1D projected data and also showing the 1D discriminant vector

## 2. Logistic Regression

## 3. Naive Bayes

## 4. ANN

We will also be seeing algorithms to do multi class classification
1. ANN
