# Classification---From-Scratch
In this project, I have implemented several classification algorithms from scratch i.e. not used any standard libraries like sklearn or tensorflow and created my own library for each algorithm, then I compared the results that we got using my custom lilbrary with the results obtained when we used standard library and see how efficiently I have implemented my own library.

  ## 1. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  Please refer to the pdf uploaded above named 'Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)' to get access to all my notes and the code implementation of this algorithms

  ## 2. Logistic Regression (LR)
  Please refer to the pdf uploaded above named 'Logistic Regression (LR)' to get access to all my notes and the code implementation of this algorithms

  ## 3. Naive Bayes (NB)
  Please refer to following link to access this project where I have solved a spam mail detection problem which is a classification problem using naive bayes algorithm and here I     have implemented naive bayes algorithms from complete scratch without using any sklearn or other equivalent ML library
