# Classification---From-Scratch
In this assignment we will be implementing several classification algorithms from scratch i.e. not use any libraries and create our own libraries then we compare our results with the results obtained when we use library and see how efficiently we have implemented our own library.

  Following algorithms have been implemented to perform binary class classification
  ## 1. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  Please refer to the pdf uploaded above named 'Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)' to get access to all my notes and the code implementation of this algorithms

  ## 2. Logistic Regression (LR)
  Please refer to the pdf uploaded above named 'Logistic Regression (LR)' to get access to all my notes and the code implementation of this algorithms

  ## 3. Naive Bayes (NB)
  please refer to following link to access this project where I have solve a spam mail detection problem which is a classificatoin problem using naive bayes algorithm and here i have implemented naive bayes algorithms from complete scratch without using any sklearn or other equivalent ML library

  ## 4. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
