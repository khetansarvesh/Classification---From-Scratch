# Classification---From-Scratch
In this assignment we will be implementing several classification algorithms from scratch i.e. not use any libraries and create our own libraries then we compare our results with the results obtained when we use library and see how efficiently we have implemented our own library

## 1. LDA

## 2. Logistic Regression

## 3. Naive Bayes

## 4. ANN

We will also be seeing algorithms to do multi class classification
1. ANN
